# Rails Partial for VSCode

Quickly create a partial from selected code of your view.

Inspired by [Rails Partial](https://github.com/wesf90/rails-partial) extension for Sublime Text.

## How it works

1. Select some code you want to move to a partial and press `Alt + P` (or call `Rails Partial: Create partial` command)
2. Enter partial name (without underscore and file extension)
3. Press `Enter`.

That's it!
