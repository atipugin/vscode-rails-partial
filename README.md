# Rails Partial for VSCode

VSCode's missing port of [Rails Partial](https://github.com/wesf90/rails-partial) extension. Works with Slim, Haml and Erb.

## How it works

1. Select some code you want to move to a partial and press `Alt + P` (or call `Rails Partial: Create partial` command)
2. Enter partial name (without underscore and file extension)
3. Press `Enter`.

That's it!

## Shortcuts

* `alt + p` - Create a partial from selection
